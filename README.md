A Spring Boot Web Application that manages a database of products (name, price, & quantity) with the ability to add products to the database and to add products to a cart for purchase. The application uses Spring Security to manage the ability to create & update products within the database. The general user role doesn't need to be logged into in order to add products to a cart & purchase, while not having access to the admin-like abilities. While the users with the “ADMIN” role have access to the ability to create new products & update or delete existing products. In addition, the database keeps track of the product history such name, price, quantity, and time of purchase for each order.
